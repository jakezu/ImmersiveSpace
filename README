realXtend based immersive space script.

This script is used to create the immersive space of six invidual client machines.
ScriptImporter jsmodule is needed to import this file into the existing scene.

To test:

Server:
Server is responsible for the hosting scene to the clients and for the creating the entity which serves offsets to the clients' cameras.
In this example server's ip-address is "192.168.1.10", port is "2345", scene file is "scene.txml" and Apache HTTP Server is used to share scene directory (<DocumentRoot>/DemoScene/) to the clients.
- make scene directory available for the client machines 
    * edit Apache httpd.conf file: 
      <Directory "<DocumentRoot>/DemoScene"> 
         Options.... 
      </Directory>
- enable ScriptImporter: open plugins.xml for editing and add <jsplugin path="ScriptImporter/ScriptImporter.js" />
- start Tundra server: tundra --server --file scene.txml
- drag and drop ImmersiveSpace.js file into the tundra window
- delete, if needed, unnecessary entities and components from the scene. FreeLookCamera entity has been automatically removed from the scene by this script

Master client:
This client is responsible for the input commands (camera moving and rotating), and sending other control messages to the server and the slave clients. Plug input devices (e.g. keyboard and mouse) to this computer.
Valid username for the master client is "client1".
- no need to enable ScriptImporter jsmodule
- make local directory for the assets (for example c:\data\assets\)
- connect to the Tundra server: 
    tundra --login tundra://192.168.1.10:2345/?username=client1 --storage "src=http://192.168.1.10/DemoScene/;localdir=c:\data\assets\;name=web"

Slave clients:
These clients just connects to the server and get's their camera offsets and other control messages from the server and Master client.
Valid username for the slave clients are "client2" ... "client6".
- no need to enable ScriptImporter jsmodule
- make local directory for the assets (for example c:\data\assets\)
- connect to the Tundra server: 
    tundra --login tundra://192.168.1.10:2345/?username=<clientID> --storage "src=http://192.168.1.10/DemoScene/;localdir=c:\data\assets\;name=web"
